"remaps" the myasus button on zenbooks to toggle hdr
-requires the actual myasus windows app to be installed. it just immediately closes it and toggles hdr... you dont even see the myasus splash screen
tested on a zenbook 14x oled 2023 (q410v)

it runs a constant listener, but it uses 1mb of ram and almost no cpu
to stop, use Task Manager, or the system tray icon
